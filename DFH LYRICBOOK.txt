This is me with all my mind
while all my power force will struggle fight
There is no more left in the light

Nothing's gonna stop me in abandoned place
And blow another struck in your faceless blame
No one ever break this flame out here before
And nothing's gonna let me lose it all

In a minute you will meet your maker in this tower
When my flames will burn you down, you feel my power

CHORUS:
I hear the silence in my fear                                              
When my memories disappeared                                      
Nothing I do has no meaning                                           
Cause now I'm falling into darkness

VERSE1:
Cure me from poison in my blood                                    
like a memory showing every second                               
I feel the pain of my pouring life                                       
Air is still dirty all those years                                          
Anger will rise at any moment                                          
I'm doing all for my satisfaction                                        
Family or friends behave like beasts                                
They just attacked me for doing nothing

VERSE2:
I have shadows in my eyes                                               
In the night I'm walking like a zombie                             
Bloody hands are cut with kitchen knife                           
In the bathtub full of the blood                                        
Sadly I'm going now to kill myself                                 
Hoping that I will become the spectral ghost                            
Area varies according to my mood                                
Sometimes rains and sometimes snows                          

CHORUS:
I hear the silence in my fear

Nothing I do has no meaning                                           
Cause now I'm falling into darkness                                
I hear the silence in my fear

Nothing I do has no meaning                                           
Cause now I'm falling into darkness   

I hear the silence
I hear the silence     
I hear the silence   
I hear the SILENCE

crawling into the torture chamber?                                 
Will you see me dying                                                     
like a blind stupid and coward?                
Will you see my murderer?                                                
it's the demon burning inside me                                    
Will you see the fear                                                       
of me falling down into darkness?

RAPVERSE1:
You don't know what you're thinking now
It's the feeling that everything's crumbling in front of you
Many of them took me as a waste of time
It's a lack of respect like as I did some crime
They will never stop me, never disappoint me, never ignore me
I'm the master around here
Here's lesson of being famous, always spam your messages to everyone
Make a list of what you want to accomplish
Make a list of all your haters below
Make a list of everything you hate, if there's no fate, there's no mate
Listen all my songs and enjoy them as much as you can
This is my own ultimate plan of being famous
If nobody appreciates you they are venomous
You must ignore them and go on through your journey

If they feel like break it down, check if there's some sound here all around
If they're walking on the street, they will feel like they're down under feet
Spirits don't speak in this ilussion, there is some kind of poisoned emission
Sky is turning blue, nobody is saying the truth for you and they lie just like you
Clock is ticking your time to die, you will forget to say goodbye
All these heroes are failures and naive morons believing in peace, their hoe is niece
Their sacrifice will not be in vein but can't handle all the pain insane
Past is irrelevant to help you now, you must read your brain somehow

There are no more obligations
when you die out there with them

BRIDGE:
Shark is chewing your right arm
Your mind remained through pain so calm
Your weak lungs are full of water
Your eyes see blood cells in quarter

You died, you died, you died, in sea
You died, you died, you died, in sea
You died, you died, you died, in sea
You died, you died, you died, in sea

Shark killed YOU

Would you swim in black sea
Would you see so far away
Would you see another day
Would you sail like overlord
Would you swim in black sea

VERSE1:
Last time 
I was all crime

And you don't know who is reaching you

Death awaits you everytime you drive home

Last day
I had bad day
And on Friday

And you don't know who's there
And you don't know who is reaching you

Stand and rise on falling ground

Chalice of souls is now filling the blood of you

Dying is just wasting time
You will see the blinding light

CHORUS:
Save me from myself today
Set me free like never before
Release me from your desire
Read me like an open door

VERSE1:
Love is gone, you want to set me free
Suffocating for being like a dying tree
Unsolved problems, hipocrisy
There is one crazy thing called destiny
No one can help me, my mind is sickened now
I don't know who I really am, I need to know somehow
Rage inside is trying to killing me
When my temper increases so deep like sea

CHORUS:
Save me from myself today
Set me free like never before
Release me from your desire
Read me like an open door

VERSE2:
Hardest stone, you want to knock me out
Suffering in my life that it's all about
In this chamber there is a hidden door
Naked female body is what I'm searching for
No one can ask me why am I born like that
I don't know if I'm alive or really dead
Rage inside is trying to breaking me
When my anger increases so deep and free

CHORUS:
Save me from myself today
Set me free like never before
Release me from your desire
Read me like an open door

VERSE1:
Where are you now
I'm looking for your soul darling
Where are you now
I'm searching for your soul darling
Nothing's gonna be the same again
Nothing's gonna be the same again

You are, my only hope for this sacred life
You are, my only hope for this sacred life
You are

VERSE2:
Where is our time

Where is our time

Nothing breaks my always empty heart
Nothing breaks my always empty heart

You-are-my-hope

------------------------------BROKEN EARTH----------------------------------

VERSE1:
I know whole truth about future of 
humans, which want to rise the technology
but it's over, people must deal with it
falling bombs and nuclear weapons all the time

You've got the power to do what you really want
But when something goes wrong then it's all your fault
This is your destiny for end of humankind
This is your prediction for future events
This is your character for destroy things
This is your personality to be the bad guy
This is the pain you make for poor people
This is the way for our sacrifice

CHORUS:
Broken earth, here collides
Broken earth, in disguise
Broken earth, is denied
Broken earth, smash the fly

RAPVERSE2:
Power is the thing that every person in the world wants to achieve
But not everyone can have it because it's a very dangerous thing
Let alone human being that learns and destroy things for its satisfaction

VERSE2:
You wanna step in awake
You wanna buried away
You gonna separate day
Just step in hole in a way
Just make a suicide
Just step in all in our pride
Deeper than sacrifice
Lying in bed for a while
You wanna step in awake
This body is made by the shine
Let's make it turn to zombie
They feel it sucking away
Now throw in into abyss
I'm down the vampire
You wanna feel in this way
Just turn in suffocation

CHORUS:
Broken earth, here collides
Broken earth, in disguise
Broken earth, is denied
Broken earth, smash the fly
Broken earth, here collides
Broken earth, in disguise
Broken earth, is denied
Broken earth, smash the fly

VERSE3:
I know whole truth about future of 
humans, which want to rise the technology
but it's over, people must deal with it
falling bombs and nuclear weapons all the time

CHORUS:
Broken earth, here collides
Broken earth, in disguise
Broken earth, is denied
Broken earth, smash the fly
Broken earth, here collides
Broken earth, in disguise
Broken earth, is denied
Broken earth, smash the fly
Broken earth, here collides
Broken earth, smash the fly

It's broken, you know

--------------------------------THE DEATH IS NEAR--------------------------------------

RAPVERSE1:
This is my story
Always afraid of death
Confused every time of what I've said
My life was really always that bad
Mistakes and bad choices made me regret
Of hopeless lies and darkened skies
I am so insecure when I read these lines
Nothing can stop me in living in my own lies
Breaking up with girl looking up for butterflies

Pressure is the thing I hate the most
Around people I'm existing like some kind of empty ghost
Burning in my own hell like a crispy toast
Falling from the sky and doing some dirty roast
I'm no angel, even not fallen
Laughing heavy on sickness and wars like I don't care
I'm just a mindless selfcared human
Nobody ever forgives me on my behaviour

This is my drama
Always ignored so far
Nobody cares that I'm falling apart
I'll take everything so softly and purely out
If I have to choose I rather go south
My problems are for me unsolvable
My fantasy is just so weirdly incredible
Destiny is really easy for me approachable
And demons like me seem so unstoppable

Everything seems so complicated on the try
People yell at me for no reason why
They just want my money and my skills
Because nothing else gives them chills
My family hates me for not being a real man
I'm just a lonely boy with the best childhood era
Blame me for my own opinions said in this song
Because everything I said could be wrong

This is why I let you go
because you were not my fateful soul
You were fake and liar and I was some real denial
Fate is just for those who believes in something
The only thing you must do is release something
Be yourself is not the solution
When you don't have real goal in motion
Death is slowly coming for you
He says I will watch over you

CHORUS:
Why I always have no fear
Why I try to disappear
Why is ever death so near
So far away
Why I always have no fear
Why I try to disappear
Why is ever death so near
So far away

VERSE2:
This is why I let you go
You were not my fateful soul
You were lone wolf on the flow
Away with you
You were not my hero guy
You were one big careless lie
You were just a sycophant
Away with you

CHORUS:
Why I always have no fear
Why I try to disappear
Why is ever death so near
So far away
Why I always have no fear
Why I try to disappear
Why is ever death so near
So far away

What you've been feeling
There is no more healing
That you've been keeping
Because you'll be petrified
What you've been feeling
There is no more healing
That you've been keeping
Because you'll be petrified

CHORUS:
Why I always have no fear
Why I try to disappear
Why is ever death so near
So far away
Why I always have no fear
Why I try to disappear
Why is ever death so near
So far away
Why I always have no fear
Why I try to disappear
Why is ever death so near
So far away
Why I always have no fear
Why I try to disappear
Why is ever death so near
So far away

You will scar my facelift
You will break my destiny
You are never escaping me
So far away


-----------------------------------------RESISTANCE------------------------------------

VERSE1:
You're the one who stands alone in the dark
No one pays attention of you commiting any crime
Police force is haunting you from every corner now
They don't know that arresting is just a wasting time
Bells of church are ringing after every midnight
You're hiding behind corner like a small innocent child
Praying for your god is your only solution
Sadness give you creeps because you don't know how to save yourself

You don't clean the mess it's the other people's job
Failure or success I think everything is pointless trap
You don't know what you have until it's really gone
Solution is demonstration of what you really hate

CHORUS:
Sand is in your eye
Everything is just a lie
Truth is that you can't deny
Your soul is mad lullaby

VERSE2:
World changes from time to time
Rebellion is not a crime
Your sins will be washed away
We will rise against them anyway

CHORUS:
Sand is in your eye
Everything is just a lie
Truth is that you can't deny
Your soul is mad lullaby
Sand is in your eye
Everything is just a lie
Truth is that you can't deny
Your soul is mad lullaby

VERSE3:
My soul is like an open world
full of people beyond the world
Watching them living in my dreams
Nothing really looks how it seems

CHORUS:
Sand is in your eye
Everything is just a lie
Truth is that you can't deny
Your soul is mad lullaby
Sand is in your eye
Everything is just a lie
Truth is that you can't deny
Your soul is mad lullaby

------------long pause------------

CHORUS:
Sand is in your eye
Everything is just a lie
Truth is that you can't deny
Your soul is mad lullaby
Sand is in your eye
Everything is just a lie
Truth is that you can't deny
Your soul is mad lullaby
Sand is in your eye
Everything is just a lie
Truth is that you can't deny
Your soul is mad lullaby
